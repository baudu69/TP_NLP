Rice cultivation in Asia dates back about 10,000 years, perhaps even longer. Rice originates from wild species in Asia, but it was the Chinese who developed irrigated rice cultivation, which was adopted by other producing countries. Traditionally, rice is sown and harvested by hand. It is grown in the Philippines, Indonesia, Korea, Japan, India and Sri Lanka. In Europe, rice was first introduced in Greece around 325 B.C., and then spread to southern Europe and some parts of North Africa. However, rice remained a marginal product until the end of the Renaissance. Rice is then known in Brazil, South and Central America. It was not until the middle of the 17th century that rice was first cultivated in the United States. Next to wheat, rice is the most consumed grain worldwide. For many people, rice is the staple of their diet, providing over 50% of their daily energy intake. It is produced in more than a hundred countries and the vast majority of the world's production and consumption is in the Orient. Among the largest producers are China, India, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Thailand.
